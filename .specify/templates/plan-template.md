# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Phase-2 Preservation Check
- [ ] Confirm no changes to existing Phase-2 frontend structure
- [ ] Confirm no changes to existing Phase-2 backend APIs
- [ ] Confirm no changes to existing Phase-2 authentication flow
- [ ] Confirm no changes to existing Phase-2 database schema
- [ ] Confirm no changes to existing Phase-2 task CRUD logic
- [ ] Confirm no changes to existing Phase-2 environment variable usage

### Architecture Doctrine Check
- [ ] Confirm no server-side session state implementation
- [ ] Confirm all state stored in database only
- [ ] Confirm AI agents do not access database directly
- [ ] Confirm AI agents interact only through MCP tools
- [ ] Confirm each request is independent and reproducible

### MCP Tool Authority Check
- [ ] Confirm all task operations by AI go through MCP tools
- [ ] Confirm MCP tools are stateless
- [ ] Confirm MCP tools map 1-to-1 with task operations
- [ ] Confirm MCP tools perform no AI reasoning
- [ ] Confirm MCP tools persist data via database only

### Chat API Doctrine Check
- [ ] Confirm primary chat endpoint follows POST /api/{user_id}/chat pattern
- [ ] Confirm stateless per request implementation
- [ ] Confirm conversation history fetched from database
- [ ] Confirm messages stored before and after agent execution
- [ ] Confirm no WebSockets, sessions, or memory in RAM

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
